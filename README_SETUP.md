## 📚 Core Architecture

### Roleplay Engine
Located in `services/roleplay/`, the engine provides:
- **Action Ledger**: Tracks and resolves user actions across turns
- **Scene State Manager**: Maintains persistent world state
- **Response Validator**: Ensures narrative quality and consistency
- **Prompt Layer Manager**: Builds comprehensive system prompts from multiple sources
- **Memory System**: Character brain with recent responses and summarization

### Prompts System
The `prompts.txt` file contains three layered prompts:
1. **System Prompt**: Narrative rules and continuity
2. **Developer Prompt**: Content style and eroticism guidelines
3. **Scene/Context Prompt**: Dynamic state tracking

### Data Storage
- Uses IndexedDB for client-side persistence
- Characters, lorebooks, chat nodes, and gallery items stored locally
- Import/export functionality for data portability
